    "In this laboratory we will experiment with text classification. The inputs to our machine learning models will be texts, each of which has a label (0 or 1). The model is trained to classify new texts as 0 or 1. In particular, we will use the dataset from the shared task *Presupposed Taxonomies: Evaluating Neural Network Semantics (PreTENS)*, part of the SemEval 2022 conference:\n",

    "    * I like trees, and in particular birches\n",
    "    * I like oaks, and in particular trees\n",
    "    \n",
    "Some of the sentences (like the first one shown above) make sense, while others (like the second one shown above) do not. The reason that these sentences do not make sense is that the relationship between the two nouns included in the sentence is not compatible with the pattern where the two nouns are inserted.\n",
    "Sentences that make sense are labeled as `1` (*acceptable*), while sentences that do not make sense are labeled as `0` (*unacceptable*). The labeling is done by human annotators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants in this shared task were asked to train a machine learning model to predict whether sentences are acceptable or unacceptable. The best model was then applied to a secret test set that was not provided to the participants, and the highest score won.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have downloaded the data from this task from their [Github repository](https://github.com/shammur/SemEval2022Task3). In total, we have approximately 20000 sentences."
